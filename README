Revision management for Django TextFields
=========================================

This app provides a model field for Django called ``RcsTextField`` --
named after `Revision Constrol System`.

Currently this app implements Subversion, Git and Bazaar backends for 
versionizing the content of the field. Other backends are planned.

The `HEAD` revision always stays in the db for maximum performance.
