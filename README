Revision management for Django TextFields
=========================================

This a app provides a model field for the django web-framework called
``RcsTextField``, named after `Revision Constrol System`.

Currently this app implements a bzr backend for versionizing the content of
the field. Other backends are planned.

The `HEAD` revision always stays in the db for maximum performance.
