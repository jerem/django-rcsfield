To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``rcsfield``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.4 or later, Django 0.96.1 and 
a somewhat recent version of bzrlib.
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/, Django 
from http://www.djangoproject.com/ and bzrlib from http://www.bazaar-vcs.org.

Most of this install notice was bluntly stolen from James Bennett's registration
package, http://code.google.com/p/django-registration/
